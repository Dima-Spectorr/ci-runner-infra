# ci-runner-host-pool — host boot.
#
# This script is deliberately SHORT, and that is the point of the whole design.
# It installs nothing. Every expensive thing a job needs — the runner agent,
# the container runtime, language toolchains, and warm dependency caches — is
# already in the golden image (see packer/ci-host-image.pkr.hcl). All this
# script does is register `ci-slots` persistent agents and get out of the way.
#
# The pool it replaces did the opposite: it downloaded and configured a runner,
# then a job installed a toolchain, then the job downloaded its dependencies,
# and then the VM was destroyed so the next job could repeat all of it. That
# repetition is the CI wall time this pool exists to delete.
#
# Agents here are NOT --ephemeral. An ephemeral agent unregisters after one job,
# which is correct when the VM dies with it and wrong here: the host must stay
# hot and keep serving. Job isolation is provided by running each job in a
# container instead of by destroying the machine.

# any workflow on a fork-able branch owns the fleet (the #1958 finding on the
# pool this replaces).
#
# Two rules, because a job has two ways out: directly as the `runner` uid, and
# from inside a container it starts (containers are the job isolation boundary
# here, so DOCKER-USER is not optional). Root is deliberately NOT fenced — this
# script and the controller's probes need metadata.

# identity instead: the broker vends tokens for the job service account only.

# for a repository whose CI never touches GCP. It is never a silent downgrade to
